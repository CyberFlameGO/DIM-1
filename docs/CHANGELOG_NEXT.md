* Dragging horizontally on items in Compare will scroll the list - even on iOS.
* Mobile users can now access Material Counts under the banner dropdown of the Vault inventory page.
* In the Armory and Collection views, craftable weapons now show their required Weapon Level in their tooltip.
* Searches that can't be saved (because they're too long, or invalid) won't show a save ⭐️ button.
* DIM should no longer get visually mangled by Android's auto-dark-mode.
* Search filters can contain comments. Only the top level comment gets saved. e.g. `/* My Cool Search */ is:handcannon perkname:firefly`.
* Fixed the loadout drawer not opening when "+ Create Loadout" is selected from the vault.
* The loadout search field has been moved to the top of the loadout menu, which should prevent iOS from going crazy. Filtering loadouts hides the other buttons as well.
